# shallowdepth

**shallowdepth** is a lightweight, local-first tracker that passively logs how you spend time on your machine—what apps you're using, when you're using them, and what kind of work you're really doing: deep or shallow.

It’s not productivity software. It’s a mirror.

## ✦ What It Does

- Watches foreground apps and windows while you work
- Logs session durations in a local database
- Helps you reflect on focus patterns over time
- Classifies time as **deep** or **shallow** based on your custom rules

## ✦ Why It Exists

Most time trackers optimize for billing or control.  
**shallowdepth** was built for *awareness*—to help you understand your attention, not maximize it.

I built it for myself. It’s open if it helps you too.

## ✦ How It Works (Under the Hood)

- Background daemon polls your active window every few seconds
- Stores session info in SQLite (no cloud, no tracking)
- Configurable mappings let you define what counts as deep or shallow
- CLI reports show daily summaries and usage trends
